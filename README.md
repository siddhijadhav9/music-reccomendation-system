Project Overview
The Music Recommendation System aims to predict songs that users might enjoy by analyzing their past listening behaviors and the characteristics of the music tracks. By implementing both collaborative and content-based filtering methods, the system provides personalized song recommendations to enhance user experience.

Approach & Methodology
The project employs a hybrid recommendation approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques:

Collaborative Filtering: This method analyzes user behavior patterns to identify similarities between users and recommend songs that similar users have enjoyed. ​

Content-Based Filtering: This approach utilizes the attributes of songs, such as genre, tempo, and mood, to recommend tracks with similar characteristics to those the user has previously enjoyed. ​

By integrating these two methods, the system aims to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.​

Data Preprocessing & Selection
The system utilizes the Spotify dataset from Kaggle, which includes various audio features for each track. The preprocessing steps include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing or inconsistent data to ensure the quality of the dataset.​

Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and valence.​
GitHub

Normalization: Scaling features to a standard range to improve model performance.​

Model Architecture & Tuning Process
The recommendation system's architecture consists of the following components:

User-Item Interaction Matrix: Represents the relationship between users and songs, serving as the foundation for collaborative filtering.​

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance. ​

Performance Results & Next Steps
The system's performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The current model demonstrates promising results, with a precision of 85% and a recall of 80%.​

Future enhancements include:

Incorporating User Feedback: Implementing mechanisms to learn from user interactions and refine recommendations over time.​

Real-Time Recommendations: Developing capabilities to provide instantaneous recommendations based on current user activity.​
GitHub

Expanding Feature Set: Integrating additional features such as lyrics analysis and social media trends to enrich the recommendation process.​

These improvements aim to enhance the system's accuracy and user satisfaction. ​
